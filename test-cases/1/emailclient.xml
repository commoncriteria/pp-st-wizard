      <h:p>
	Email clients are user applications that provide functionality to send, receive, access and manage email.
	The complexity of email content and email clients has grown over time.
	Modern email clients can render HTML as well as plaintext,
	and may include functionality to display common attachment formats, such as Adobe PDF and  Microsoft Word documents.
	Some email clients allow their functionality to be modified by users through the addition of add-ons.
	Protocols have also been defined for communicating between email clients and servers.
	Some clients support multiple protocols for doing the same task,
	allowing them to be configured according to email server specifications.
      </h:p>
      <h:p>
	The complexity
	and rich feature set of modern email clients make them a target for attackers, introducing
	security concerns. This document is intended to facilitate the improvement of email client
	security by requiring use of operating system security services, cryptographic standards, and
	environmental mitigations. Additionally, the requirements in this document define acceptable
	behavior for email clients regardless of the security features provided by the operating
	system.
      </h:p>
      <h:p>
	This Module along with the Protection Profile for Application
	Software (<cite linkend="bibAppPP"/>) provide a baseline set of Security Functional
	Requirements (SFRs) for email clients running on any operating system regardless of the
	composition of the underlying platform.
      </h:p>
      <h:p>
	The terms email client and TOE are interchangeable in this document.

  <chapter title="Security Problem Description" id="spd">
    <h:p>
      The security problem is described in terms of the threats that the email client is expected to address, assumptions about the operational environment, and any organizational security policies that it is expected to enforce.
    </h:p>
    <h:p>
      This Extended Package does not repeat the threats, assumptions, and organizational security policies identified in the ApSo PP, though they all apply given the conformance and hence dependence of
      this <abbr linkend="PP-Module"/> on it.
      Together the threats, assumptions and organizational security
      policies of the ApSo PP and those defined in this <abbr linkend="PP-Module"/> describe those addressed
      by an email client as the Target of Evaluation.
    </h:p>
    <h:p>
      Notably, email clients are particularly at risk from the Network Attack threat identified in the ApSo PP.
      Attackers can send malicious email messages directly to users,
      and the email client will render or otherwise process this untrusted
      content.
    </h:p>
    <section title="Threats" id="threats"> The following threat is specific to email
    clients, and represents an addition to those identified in the Base PP.
    <threats>
      <threat id="T.FLAWED_ADDON">
	<description> Email client functionality can be extended with integration of third-party
	utilities and tools. This expanded set of capabilities is made possible via the use of
	add-ons. The tight integration between the basic email client code and the new
	capabilities that add-ons provide increases the risk that malefactors could inject
	serious flaws into the email client application, either maliciously by an attacker, or
	accidentally by a developer. These flaws enable undesirable behaviors including, but not
	limited to, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information in the email client,
	unauthorized access to the device's file system, or even privilege escalation that
	enables unauthorized access to other applications or the operating system.

		<TSS/>
		The evaluator verifies that the version of S/MIME implemented by the email client is present in the TSS. The evaluator also verifies that the algorithms supported are specified, and that the algorithms specified are those listed for this component.
		<h:br/>The evaluator verifies that the TSS describes the ContentEncryptionAlgorithmIdentifier and whether the required behavior is performed by default or may be configured.
		<h:br/>The evaluator verifies that the TSS describes the digestAlgorithm and whether the required behavior is performed by default or may be configured.

		<h:br/>The evaluator verifies that the TSS describes the retrieval mechanisms for both certificates and certificate revocation as well as the frequency at which these mechanisms are implemented.

		<Guidance/>
		The evaluator also reviews the Operational Guidance to ensure that it contains instructions on configuring the email client such that it complies with the description in the TSS.
		<h:br/>If the TSS indicates that the algorithms in FCS_SMIME_EXT.1.2 must be configured to meet the requirement, the evaluator verifies that the AGD guidance includes the configuration of this ID.
		<h:br/>If the TSS indicates that the algorithms in FCS_SMIME_EXT.1.3 must be configured to meet the requirement, the evaluator verifies that the AGD guidance includes the configuration.
		<h:br/>If the TSS indicates that the algorithms in FCS_SMIME_EXT.1.4 must be configured to meet the requirement, the evaluator verifies that the AGD guidance includes the configuration of this ID.
		<h:br/>If the TSS indicates that the mechanisms in FCS_SMIME_EXT.1.7 are configurable, the evaluator verifies that the AGD guidance includes the configuration of these mechanisms.
		<Tests/>
		The evaluator performs the following tests:
		<h:br/>These tests can be performed in conjunction with the tests specified in FIA_X509_EXT.1 (defined in <cite linkend="bibApp"/>) for certificate/certificate chain verification and FDP_NOT_EXT.1.
		<h:br/>Test 1: The evaluator both sends and receives a message with no protection (no signature or encryption) and verify that the message is transmitted properly and can be viewed at the receiving agent. This transmission can be performed as part of a number of mechanisms; it is sufficient to observe that the message arrives at the intended recipient with the same content as when sent.
		<h:br/>Test 2: The evaluator both sends and receives a signed message using each of the algorithms specified in the ST corresponding to the requirement and verify that the signature is valid for both received and sent messages. After verifying the signatures are valid, the evaluator sends a signed message using each of the algorithms specified in the ST and use a maninthemiddle tool to modify at least one byte of the message such that the signature is no longer valid. This can be done by modifying the content of the message over which the signature is calculated or by modifying the signature itself. The evaluator verifies that the received message fails the signature validation check.
		<h:br/>Test 3: The evaluator both sends and receives an encrypted message using each of the algorithms specified in the ST.
		The evaluator verifies that the contents are encrypted in transit and that the received message decrypts. 
		After verifying the message decrypts, the evaluator sends an encrypted message using each of the algorithms specified in the ST and use a maninthemiddle tool to modify at least one byte of the message such that the encryption is no longer valid. The evaluator verifies that the received message fails to decrypt.
		<h:br/>Test 4: The evaluator both sends and receives a message that is both signed and encrypted. In addition, the evaluator uses a man-in-the-middle tool to modify at least one byte of the message such that the encryption and signature are no longer valid. The evaluator verifies that the received message fails to decrypt, fails the signature validation check, and/or both.
		<h:br/>Test 5: The evaluator sends a signed message to the email client using a signature algorithm not supported according to the digestAlgorithm ID (e.g., SHA1). The evaluator verifies that the email client provides a notification that the contents cannot be verified because the signature algorithm is not supported.
		<h:br/>Test 6: The evaluator sends an encrypted message to the email client using an encryption algorithm not supported according to the AlgorithmIdentifier field. The evaluator verifies that the email client does not display/decrypt the contents of the message.
		<h:br/>Test 7: The evaluator sends the email client a message signed by a certificate without the digitalSignature bit set. The evaluator verifies that the email client notifies the user that the signature is invalid.
		<h:br/>Test 8: The evaluator sends the email client a message signed by a certificate without the Email Protection purpose in the extendedKeyUsage. The evaluator verifies that the email client notifies the user that the signature is invalid.
		<h:br/>Test 9: The evaluator verifies that the email client uses OCSP or downloads the CRL at the assigned frequency.

		<TSS/>
		If the platform provides the key destruction, then the evaluator examines the TSS to verify that it describes how the key destruction functionality is invoked.
		<h:br/>If the application invokes key destruction, the evaluator checks to ensure the TSS describes each of the secret keys (keys used for symmetric encryption and/or data authentication), private keys, and CSPs used to generate key; when they are zeroized (for example, immediately after use, on system shutdown, etc.); and the type of zeroization procedure that is performed (overwrite with zeros, overwrite three times with random pattern, etc.). If different types of memory are used to store the materials to be protected, the evaluator checks to ensure that the TSS describes the zeroization procedure in terms of the memory in which the data are stored (for example, "secret keys stored on a drive are zeroized by overwriting once with zeros, while secret keys stored on the internal hard drive are zeroized by overwriting three times with a random pattern that is changed before each write").
		<Tests/>
		The following test is only for key destruction provided by the email client:
		<h:br/>Test 1: For each type of authorization service, encryption mode and encryption operation, a known authorization factor, and chain of keys must be provided to the evaluator with an associated ciphertext data set (e.g. if a passphrase is used to create a intermediate key, then the ciphertext containing the encrypted key as well as the intermediate key itself must be provided to the evaluator.) The evaluator will use the email client in conjunction with a debugging or forensics utility to attempt to authorize themselves, resulting in the generation of a key or decryption of a key. The evaluator will ascertain from the TSS what the vendor defines as "no longer needed" and execute the sequence of actions via the email client to invoke this state. At this point, the evaluator should take a dump of volatile memory and search the retrieved dump for the provided authorization credentials or keys (e.g. if the password was "PaSSw0rd", perform a string search of the forensics dump for "PaSSw0rd"). The evaluator must document each command, program or action taken during this process, and must confirm that no plaintext keying material resides in volatile memory. The evaluator must perform this test three times to ensure repeatability. If during the course of this testing the evaluator finds that keying material remains in volatile memory, they should be able to identify the cause (i.e. execution of the grep command for "PaSSw0rd" caused a false positive) and document the reason for failure to comply with this requirement. The evaluator will repeat this same test, but looking for keying material in nonvolatile memory.

		  For these management functions, the term "Administrator" refers
		  to the administrator of a non-mobile device or the device owner of a mobile device.
		  The Administrator is responsible for management activities, including setting the
		  policy that is applied by the enterprise on the email client. The Administrator could
		  be acting remotely and could be the MTA administrator acting through a centralized
		  management console or dashboard. Applications used to configure enterprise policy
		  should have their own identification and authorization and additional security
		  requirements to ensure that the remote administration is trusted.
		  </h:p><h:p>
		  The intent of
		  this requirement is to allow the Administrator to configure the email client with a
		  policy that may not be over-ridden by the user. If the Administrator has not set a
		  policy for a particular function, the user may still perform that function.
		  Enforcement of the policy is done by the email client itself, or the email client and
		  the email client platform in coordination with each other.
		  </h:p><h:p>
		  The function to
		  configure whether to establish a trusted channel corresponds to the functionality
		  described in FIA_X509_EXT.2.2 (<cite linkend="bibAppPP"/>). The Administrator has the
		  option of accepting or rejecting all certificates that cannot be validated, accepting
		  a given certificate that cannot be validated, or not accepting a given certificate
		  that cannot be validated. Depending on the choice that the Administrator has made in
		  FIA_X509_EXT.2.2 (<cite linkend="bibAppPP"/>), the trusted connection will either be
		  allowed for all certificates that cannot be validated, disallowed for all certificates
		  that cannot be validated, allowed for a given certificate that cannot be validated, or
		  disallowed for a given certificate that cannot be validated. 
		  </h:p><h:p>
		  If password or
		  passphrase authorization factors are implemented by the email client, then the
		  appropriate "change" selection must be included. 
		  </h:p><h:p>
		  If the email client provides
		  configurability of the cryptographic functions (for example, key size), even if the
		  configuration is the form of parameters that may be passed to cryptographic
		  functionality implement on the email client platform, then "configure cryptographic
		  functionality" will be included, and the specifics of the functionality offered can
		  either be written in this requirement as bullet points, or included in the <abbr
		  linkend="TSS"/>. 
		  </h:p><h:p>
		  If the email client does include a key recovery function, the
		  email client must provide the capability for the user to turn this functionality off
		  so that no recovery key is generated and no keys are permitted to be exported.

	  <note role="application">
	    <h:p>
	      The password/passphrase is represented on the host machine as a
	      sequence of characters whose encoding depends on the email client and the underlying
	      OS. This sequence must be conditioned into a string of bits that is to be used as a
	      key of equivalent size to the rest of the key chain. 
	      </h:p><h:p>
	      This password/passphrase
	      must be conditioned into a string of bits that forms the submask to be used as input
	      into a key. Conditioning can be performed using one of the identified hash functions
	      or the process described in NIST SP 800-132; the method used is selected by the <abbr
	      linkend="ST"/> Author. SP 800-132 requires the use of a pseudo-random function (PRF)
	      consisting of HMAC with an approved hash function. The <abbr linkend="ST"/> author
	      selects the hash function used, also includes the appropriate requirements for HMAC
	      and the hash function. 
	      </h:p><h:p>
	      Appendix A of SP 800-132 recommends setting the iteration
	      count in order to increase the computation needed to derive a key from a password and,
	      therefore, increase the workload of performing a password recovery attack. However,
	      for this <abbr linkend="PP-Module"/>, a minimum iteration count of 4096 is required in order
	      to ensure that twelve bits of security is added to the password/passphrase value. A
	      significantly higher value is recommended to ensure optimal security. 
	      </h:p><h:p>
	      There are
	      two aspects of this component that require evaluation: passwords/passphrases of the
	      length specified in the requirement (at least 64 characters) are supported, and that
	      the characters that are input are subject to the selected conditioning function. These
	      activities are separately addressed in the tests below.
	    </h:p>
	  </note>
	  <aactivity>
	    <TSS/>
	    The evaluator verifies that the TSS section specifies the capability that exists to accept passwords/passphrases with the minimum number of characters specified in the ST in this assignment statement.
	    <h:br/>The evaluator examines the password hierarchy TSS to ensure that the formation of all keys is described and that the key sizes match that described by the ST author.
	    The evaluator checks that the TSS describes the method by which the password/passphrase is first encoded and then fed to the SHA algorithm. The settings for the algorithm (padding, blocking, etc.) shall be described, and the evaluator verifies that these are supported by the selections in this component as well as the selections concerning the hash function itself. The evaluator verifies that the TSS contains a description of how the output of the hash function is used to form the submask that will be input into the function. For the NIST SP 800132based conditioning of the password/passphrase, the required evaluation activities will be performed when doing the evaluation activities for the appropriate requirements (FCS_COP.1.1(4) in <cite linkend="bibApp"/>). If any manipulation of the key is performed in forming the submask that will be used to form the key, that process shall be described in the TSS. No explicit testing of the formation of the submask from the input password is required.
	    <Guidance/>
	    The evaluators shall check the Operational Guidance to determine that there are instructions for guidance on how to generate large passwords/passphrases external to the email client and instructions for how to configure the password/passphrase length and optional complexity settings (note to Management section). This is important because many default settings for passwords/passphrases will not meet the necessary entropy needed as specified in this EP.
	    <Tests/>The evaluator will also perform the following tests:
	    <h:ul>
	      <h:li>Test 1: Ensure that the email client supports passwords/passphrases of 64 characters</h:li>
	      <h:li>Test 2: Try entering a password/passphrase less than 64 characters.</h:li>
	      <h:li>Test 3: If the email client supports a password/passphrase length up to a maximum number of characters, n (which would be greater than 64), then ensure that the email client will not accept more than n characters. Conditioning: No explicit testing of the formation of the authorization factor from the input password/passphrase is required.</h:li>
	    </h:ul>
	    <h:br/>The evaluator verifies that the iteration count for PBKDFs performed by the email client comply with NIST SP 800132 by ensuring that the TSS contains a description of the estimated time required to derive key material from passwords and how the email client increases the computation time for passwordbased key derivation (including but not limited to increasing the iteration count).
